Fast Fashion; CLOTHES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DISPOSABLE; Fast fashion is a term for clothes that are based on the most recent fashion trends. These trends change quickly and that is where the term comes from. Fast fashion brands, such as H&M and Zara, are not necessarily creating pieces to last a long time, since their goal is to produce new trendy clothes as quick as possible. Fast fashion has also become associated with disposable fashion because it has delivered designer product to a mass market at relatively low prices. Fast fashion has negative societal and environmental impacts.
Microplastic; EACH YEAR THE FASHION INDUSTRY RELEASES AS MUCH AS 50 BILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES WORTH OF MICROPLASICS TO THE SEA; Microplastics are very small pieces of plastic that pollute the environment. They are not a specific kind of plastic, but rather any type of plastic fragment that are smaller than half a centimeter in diameter. These plastics are ingested by animals and even humans, since they are small, they degrade slowly and are hard to filter out from the water. Some of these plastics are released by the fashion industry and even when washing polyester clothes in a machine, microplastics are released since the machines can’t filter the plastics.
Fiber Blends; STAY AWAY FROM BLENDS; Blended fibers are made from mixing two or more materials together. The reason why they are not eco-friendly is because blended fibers cannot be recycled, technology doesn’t exist to separate the fibers yet.
Water; IT TAKES 2700 LITERS OF WATER TO MAKE ONE COTTON T-SHIRT; which is as much water as a person drinks approximately in 2 and a half years.
